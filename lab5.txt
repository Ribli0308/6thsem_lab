SET:
*myset1 = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
*myset2 = set()
*myset1.add(12)
*myset1.update([20, 30]) --> set of elements will be appended at the end of the set
*remove() --> throws error if element is not present
*update() --> doesn't throw error
*myset1.clear() --> delete all elements of the set
*union() | --> myset3 = myset1 | myset2, myset1.union(myset2)
*intersection() &
*differnece() add()
*n = int(input("Specify size"))
 myset = set()
 for i in range(n):
  myset.add(int(input("enetr element")))
DICTIONARY:

 print("The roll is: %d" %mydict["Roll"])
 mydict["Dept"] = "CSE"
*mydict2 = {}
